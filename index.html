    <p>Sea turtles are fascinating marine reptiles that belong to the family Cheloniidae and Dermochelyidae.Sea turtles are found in all the world's oceans, except for the polar regions.The size and lifespan of sea turtles vary among species. The largest species is the Leatherback turtle, which can reach lengths of up to 7 feet (2 meters) and weigh over 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms). Green turtles and loggerhead turtles also grow quite large. Sea turtles generally have long lifespans, with some individuals living over 100 years.<br>

    <h2>Introduction Of The Sri Lankan Turtle Population</h2>
    <br>
    <section class="intro">
      <p>The Sri Lankan turtle population is a diverse and important group of marine reptiles found along the coasts and waters of Sri Lanka, an island nation located in the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka is known for its rich biodiversity and is home to several species of turtles that play a crucial role in the marine ecosystem.One of the most iconic turtle species in Sri Lanka is the Olive Ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea). These turtles are known for their olive-colored shells and are considered the most abundant sea turtle species in Sri Lankan waters. They undertake long-distance migrations and are known to nest on the sandy beaches of Sri Lanka, attracting conservation efforts to protect their nesting sites.Another prominent turtle species in Sri Lanka is the Green turtle (Chelonia mydas). These turtles are characterized by their large size, greenish skin, and herbivorous diet. The coastal waters of Sri Lanka provide important feeding grounds for green turtles, and they also nest on Sri Lankan beaches. The conservation of green turtles is of particular concern due to their vulnerability to habitat degradation and human activities.The Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) is another species found in Sri Lanka. Recognizable by their unique overlapping shell plates, hawksbill turtles are known for their role in maintaining the health of coral reefs. They feed on sponges, which helps to control sponge populations and allows other organisms to thrive. Hawksbill turtles are listed as critically endangered, and their protection is crucial for the preservation of coral reef ecosystems.The Sri Lankan turtle population not only holds ecological significance but also contributes to the country's tourism industry. Many visitors come to Sri Lanka to witness the awe-inspiring sight of turtle nesting and hatching, offering economic incentives for the conservation and preservation of these majestic creatures.While challenges such as habitat degradation, pollution, climate change, and illegal poaching continue to pose threats to the Sri Lankan turtle population, concerted efforts are being made to ensure their long-term survival. Through conservation initiatives, research, and public awareness, it is hoped that these remarkable creatures will continue to thrive in the waters and beaches of Sri Lanka for generations to come.</p>
